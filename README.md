## Simplest Banking App
##### I created a simple banking app.
###### What is in Lab 3:
You can find the class Currency, which allows you to convert between three currencies: dollar, yuan, and pound. You can find classes Dollar, Yuan, and Pound which return a string that consists of value and currency in the proper form of singular or plural. There is also a code for class Bank which returns various strings depending on which currency you are inputting and another set of strings signifying either successful or unsuccessful statements of deposit.
###### Relationship between lab 3 and project:
I tied the code I wrote for lab 3 into a flask application.
###### Dependencies:
Flask needs to be imported. Code in the lab3_code.py needs to be imported. Both needs to be imported in SI507_project1.py. You can either pip install flask yourself or use the given requirements.txt file.
###### What to do to run project properly:
After the flask setup,cd to where you downloaded the project files, and then enter "python SI507_project1.py runserver"
Then, enter the given url which will look similarly to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Once you're done investigating, go back to the command prompt and press ctrl+c to quit.
